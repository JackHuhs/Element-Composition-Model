# Percent Composition Pie Chart

## Directions
You can either select a compound from a list, or type in your own using chemical symbols, then it will create a pie chart to show the percentage of each element by mass in the compound. Does require connection to the internet to load, but not to run.

## Description
The piechart has a key and percents next to each of the colors. Each element has as different color. There is a variety of compounds you can choose from if you do not want to type one in yourself, including chemicals such as caffeine and ibuprofen. 

## Notes
Only supports chemicals with up to 12 different elements due to limited colors that look sufficiently different from each other. More may be added later. Superscripts for the elements are not required and will not work. Polyatomic ions are not supported.
